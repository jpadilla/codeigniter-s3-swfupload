	// BROWSE NODE LOOKUP

	/**
	 * Method: browse_node_lookup()
	 * 	Given a browse node ID, <browse_node_lookup()> returns the specified browse node's name, children, and ancestors. The names and browse node IDs of the children and ancestor browse nodes are also returned. <browse_node_lookup()> enables you to traverse the browse node hierarchy to find a browse node.
	 *
	 * 	If you added your Associates ID to the config.inc.php file, or you passed it into the AmazonAAWS() constructor, it will be passed along in this request automatically.
	 *
	 * Access:
	 * 	public
	 *
	 * Parameters:
	 * 	browse_node_id - _integer_ (Required) A positive integer assigned by Amazon that uniquely identifies a product category.
	 * 	opt - _array_ (Optional) Associative array of parameters which can have the following keys:
	 * 	locale - _string_ (Optional) Which Amazon-supported locale do we use? Defaults to United States.
	 *
	 * Keys for the $opt parameter:
	 * 	ContentType - _string_ (Optional) Specifies the format of the content in the response. Generally, ContentType should only be changed for REST requests when the Style parameter is set to an XSLT stylesheet. For example, to transform your Amazon Associates Web Service response into HTML, set ContentType to text/html. Allows 'text/xml' and 'text/html'. Defaults to 'text/xml'.
	 * 	MerchantId - _string_ (Optional) An alphanumeric token distributed by Amazon that uniquely identifies a merchant. Allows 'All', 'Amazon', 'FeaturedBuyBoxMerchant', or a specific Merchant ID. Defaults to 'Amazon'.
	 * 	ResponseGroup - _string_ (Optional) Specifies the types of values to return. You can specify multiple response groups in one request by separating them with commas. Allows 'BrowseNodeInfo' (default), 'NewReleases', 'TopSellers'.
	 * 	returnCurlHandle - _boolean_ (Optional) A private toggle that will return the CURL handle for the request rather than actually completing the request. This is useful for MultiCURL requests.
	 * 	Style - _string_ (Optional) Controls the format of the data returned in Amazon Associates Web Service responses. Set this parameter to "XML," the default, to generate a pure XML response. Set this parameter to the URL of an XSLT stylesheet to have Amazon Associates Web Service transform the XML response. See ContentType.
	 * 	Validate - _boolean_ (Optional) Prevents an operation from executing. Set the Validate parameter to True to test your request without actually executing it. When present, Validate must equal True; the default value is False. If a request is not actually executed (Validate=True), only a subset of the errors for a request may be returned because some errors (for example, no_exact_matches) are only generated during the execution of a request. Defaults to FALSE.
	 * 	XMLEscaping - _string_ (Optional) Specifies whether responses are XML-encoded in a single pass or a double pass. By default, XMLEscaping is Single, and Amazon Associates Web Service responses are encoded only once in XML. For example, if the response data includes an ampersand character (&), the character is returned in its regular XML encoding (&). If XMLEscaping is Double, the same ampersand character is XML-encoded twice (&amp;). The Double value for XMLEscaping is useful in some clients, such as PHP, that do not decode text within XML elements. Defaults to 'Single'.

	// CART METHODS

	/**
	 * Method: cart_add()
	 * 	Enables you to add items to an existing remote shopping cart. <cart_add()> can only be used to place a new item in a shopping cart. It cannot be used to increase the quantity of an item already in the cart. If you would like to increase the quantity of an item that is already in the cart, you must use the <cart_modify()> operation.
	 *
	 * 	You add an item to a cart by specifying the item's OfferListingId, or ASIN and ListItemId. Once in a cart, an item can only be identified by its CartItemId. That is, an item in a cart cannot be accessed by its ASIN or OfferListingId. CartItemId is returned by <cart_create()>, <cart_get()>, and <cart_add()>.
	 *
	 * 	To add items to a cart, you must specify the cart using the CartId and HMAC values, which are returned by the <cart_create()> operation.
	 *
	 * 	If you added your Associates ID to the config.inc.php file, or you passed it into the AmazonAAWS() constructor, it will be passed along in this request automatically.
	 *
	 * Access:
	 * 	public
	 *
	 * Parameters:
	 * 	cart_id - _string_ (Required) Alphanumeric token returned by <cart_create()> that identifies a cart.
	 * 	hmac - _string_ (Required) Encrypted alphanumeric token returned by <cart_create()> that authorizes access to a cart.
	 * 	offer_listing_id - _string|array_ (Required) Either a string containing the Offer ID to add, or an associative array where the Offer ID is the key and the quantity is the value. An offer listing ID is an alphanumeric token that uniquely identifies an item. Use the OfferListingId instead of an item's ASIN to add the item to the cart.
	 * 	opt - _array_ (Optional) Associative array of parameters which can have the following keys:
	 * 	locale - _string_ (Optional) Which Amazon-supported locale do we use? Defaults to United States.
	 *
	 * Keys for the $opt parameter:
	 * 	ContentType - _string_ (Optional) Specifies the format of the content in the response. Generally, ContentType should only be changed for REST requests when the Style parameter is set to an XSLT stylesheet. For example, to transform your Amazon Associates Web Service response into HTML, set ContentType to text/html. Allows 'text/xml' and 'text/html'. Defaults to 'text/xml'.
	 * 	MergeCart - _boolean_ (Optional) A boolean value that when True specifies that the items in a customer's remote shopping cart are added to the customer's Amazon retail shopping cart. This occurs when the customer elects to purchase the items in their remote shopping cart. When the value is False the remote shopping cart contents are not added to the retail shopping cart. Instead, the customer is sent directly to the Order Pipeline when they elect to purchase the items in their cart. This parameter is valid only in the US locale. In all other locales, the parameter is invalid but the request behaves as though the value were set to True.
	 * 	MerchantId - _string_ (Optional) An alphanumeric token distributed by Amazon that uniquely identifies a merchant. Allows 'All', 'Amazon', 'FeaturedBuyBoxMerchant', or a specific Merchant ID. Defaults to 'Amazon'.
	 * 	ResponseGroup - _string_ (Optional) Specifies the types of values to return. You can specify multiple response groups in one request by separating them with commas.
	 * 	returnCurlHandle - _boolean_ (Optional) A private toggle that will return the CURL handle for the request rather than actually completing the request. This is useful for MultiCURL requests.
	 * 	Style - _string_ (Optional) Controls the format of the data returned in Amazon Associates Web Service responses. Set this parameter to "XML," the default, to generate a pure XML response.

	/**
	 * Method: cart_clear()
	 * 	Enables you to remove all of the items in a remote shopping cart, including SavedForLater items. To remove only some of the items in a cart or to reduce the quantity of one or more items, use <cart_modify()>.
	 *
	 * 	To delete all of the items from a remote shopping cart, you must specify the cart using the CartId and HMAC values, which are returned by the <cart_create()> operation. A value similar to the HMAC, URLEncodedHMAC, is also returned. This value is the URL encoded version of the HMAC. This encoding is necessary because some characters, such as + and /, cannot be included in a URL. Rather than encoding the HMAC yourself, use the URLEncodedHMAC value for the HMAC parameter.
	 *
	 * 	<cart_clear()> does not work after the customer has used the PurchaseURL to either purchase the items or merge them with the items in their Amazon cart. Carts exist even though they have been emptied. The lifespan of a cart is 7 days since the last time it was acted upon. For example, if a cart created 6 days ago is modified, the cart lifespan is reset to 7 days.

	/**
	 * Method: cart_create()
	 * 	Enables you to create a remote shopping cart. A shopping cart is the metaphor used by most e-commerce solutions. It is a temporary data storage structure that resides on Amazon servers. The structure contains the items a customer wants to buy. In Amazon Associates Web Service, the shopping cart is considered remote because it is hosted by Amazon servers. In this way, the cart is remote to the vendor's web site where the customer views and selects the items they want to purchase.
	 *
	 * 	Once you add an item to a cart by specifying the item's ListItemId and ASIN, or OfferListing ID, the item is assigned a CartItemId and accessible only by that value. That is, in subsequent requests, an item in a cart cannot be accessed by its ListItemId and ASIN, or OfferListingId.
	 *
	 * 	Because the contents of a cart can change for different reasons, such as item availability, you should not keep a copy of a cart locally. Instead, use the other cart operations to modify the cart contents. For example, to retrieve contents of the cart, which are represented by CartItemIds, use <cart_get()>.
	 *
	 * 	Available products are added as cart items. Unavailable items, for example, items out of stock, discontinued, or future releases, are added as SaveForLaterItems. No error is generated. The Amazon database changes regularly. You may find a product with an offer listing ID but by the time the item is added to the cart the product is no longer available. The checkout page in the Order Pipeline clearly lists items that are available and those that are SaveForLaterItems.
	 *
	 * 	It is impossible to create an empty shopping cart. You have to add at least one item to a shopping cart using a single <cart_create()> request. You can add specific quantities (up to 999) of each item. <cart_create()> can be used only once in the life cycle of a cart. To modify the contents of the cart, use one of the other cart operations.
	 *
	 * 	Carts cannot be deleted. They expire automatically after being unused for 7 days. The lifespan of a cart restarts, however, every time a cart is modified. In this way, a cart can last for more than 7 days. If, for example, on day 6, the customer modifies a cart, the 7 day countdown starts over.
	 *
	 * 	If you added your Associates ID to the config.inc.php file, or you passed it into the AmazonAAWS() constructor, it will be passed along in this request automatically.
	 *
	 * Access:
	 * 	public
	 *
	 * Parameters:
	 * 	offer_listing_id - _string|array_ (Required) Either a string containing the Offer ID to add, or an associative array where the Offer ID is the key and the quantity is the value. An offer listing ID is an alphanumeric token that uniquely identifies an item. Use the OfferListingId instead of an item's ASIN to add the item to the cart.
	 * 	opt - _array_ (Optional) Associative array of parameters which can have the following keys:
	 * 	locale - _string_ (Optional) Which Amazon-supported locale do we use? Defaults to United States.
	 *
	 * Keys for the $opt parameter:
	 * 	ContentType - _string_ (Optional) Specifies the format of the content in the response. Generally, ContentType should only be changed for REST requests when the Style parameter is set to an XSLT stylesheet. For example, to transform your Amazon Associates Web Service response into HTML, set ContentType to text/html. Allows 'text/xml' and 'text/html'. Defaults to 'text/xml'.
	 * 	MergeCart - _boolean_ (Optional) A boolean value that when True specifies that the items in a customer's remote shopping cart are added to the customer's Amazon retail shopping cart. This occurs when the customer elects to purchase the items in their remote shopping cart. When the value is False the remote shopping cart contents are not added to the retail shopping cart.

In all other locales, the parameter is invalid but the request behaves as though the value were set to True.
	 * 	MerchantId - _string_ (Optional) An alphanumeric token distributed by Amazon that uniquely identifies a merchant. Allows 'All', 'Amazon', 'FeaturedBuyBoxMerchant', or a specific Merchant ID. Defaults to 'Amazon'.
	 * 	ResponseGroup - _string_ (Optional) Specifies the types of values to return. You can specify multiple response groups in one request by separating them with commas.
	 * 	returnCurlHandle - _boolean_ (Optional) A private toggle that will return the CURL handle for the request rather than actually completing the request. This is useful for MultiCURL requests.
	 * 	Style - _string_ (Optional) Controls the format of the data returned in Amazon Associates Web Service responses. Set this parameter to "XML," the default, to generate a pure XML response. Set this parameter to the URL of an XSLT stylesheet to have Amazon Associates Web Service transform the XML response. See ContentType.
	 * 	Validate - _boolean_ (Optional) Prevents an operation from executing. Set the Validate parameter to True to test your request without actually executing it. When present, Validate must equal True; the default value is False. If a request is not actually executed (Validate=True), only a subset of the errors for a request may be returned because some errors (for example, no_exact_matches) are only generated during the execution of a request.

	/**
	 * Method: cart_get()
	 * 	Enables you to retrieve the IDs, quantities, and prices of all of the items, including SavedForLater items in a remote shopping cart.
	 *
	 * 	Because the contents of a cart can change for different reasons, such as availability, you should not keep a copy of a cart locally. Instead, use <cart_get()> to retrieve the items in a remote shopping cart. To retrieve the items in a cart, you must specify the cart using the CartId and HMAC values, which are returned in the <cart_create()> operation. A value similar to HMAC, URLEncodedHMAC, is also returned.
	 *
	 * 	This value is the URL encoded version of the HMAC. This encoding is necessary because some characters, such as + and /, cannot be included in a URL. Rather than encoding the HMAC yourself, use the URLEncodedHMAC value for the HMAC parameter.
	 *
	 * 	<cart_get()> does not work after the customer has used the PurchaseURL to either purchase the items or merge them with the items in their Amazon cart.
	 *
	 * Access:
	 * 	public
	 *
	 * Parameters:
	 * 	cart_id - _string_ (Required) Alphanumeric token returned by <cart_create()> that identifies a cart.
	 * 	hmac - _string_ (Required) Encrypted alphanumeric token returned by <cart_create()> that authorizes access to a cart.
	 * 	cart_item_id - _string_ (Required) Alphanumeric token that uniquely identifies an item in a cart. Once an item, specified by an ASIN or OfferListingId, has been added to a cart, you must use the CartItemId to refer to it. The other identifiers will not work.
	 * 	opt - _array_ (Optional) Associative array of parameters which can have the following keys:
	 * 	locale - _string_ (Optional) Which Amazon-supported locale do we use? Defaults to United States.
	 *
	 * Keys for the $opt parameter:
	 * 	ContentType - _string_ (Optional) Specifies the format of the content in the response. Generally, ContentType should only be changed for REST requests when the Style parameter is set to an XSLT stylesheet. For example, to transform your Amazon Associates Web Service response into HTML, set ContentType to text/html. Allows 'text/xml' and 'text/html'. Defaults to 'text/xml'.
	 * 	MergeCart - _boolean_ (Optional) A boolean value that when True specifies that the items in a customer's remote shopping cart are added to the customer's Amazon retail shopping cart. This occurs when the customer elects to purchase the items in their remote shopping cart. When the value is False the remote shopping cart contents are not added to the retail shopping cart. Instead, the customer is sent directly to the Order Pipeline when they elect to purchase the items in their cart. This parameter is valid only in the US locale. In all other locales, the parameter is invalid but the request behaves as though the value were set to True.
	 * 	MerchantId - _string_ (Optional) An alphanumeric token distributed by Amazon that uniquely identifies a merchant. Allows 'All', 'Amazon', 'FeaturedBuyBoxMerchant', or a specific Merchant ID. Defaults to 'Amazon'.
	 * 	ResponseGroup - _string_ (Optional) Specifies the types of values to return. You can specify multiple response groups in one request by separating them with commas.
	 * 	returnCurlHandle - _boolean_ (Optional) A private toggle that will return the CURL handle for the request rather than actually completing the request. This is useful for MultiCURL requests.
	 * 	Style - _string_ (Optional) Controls the format of the data returned in Amazon Associates Web Service responses. Set this parameter to "XML," the default, to generate a pure XML response. Set this parameter to the URL of an XSLT stylesheet to have Amazon Associates Web Service transform the XML response. See ContentType.
	 * 	Validate - _boolean_ (Optional) Prevents an operation from executing. Set the Validate parameter to True to test your request without actually executing it. When present, Validate must equal True; the default value is False. If a request is not actually executed (Validate=True), only a subset of the errors for a request may be returned because some errors (for example, no_exact_matches) are only generated during the execution of a request. Defaults to FALSE.
	 * 	XMLEscaping - _string_ (Optional) Specifies whether responses are XML-encoded in a single pass or a double pass. By default, XMLEscaping is Single, and Amazon Associates Web Service responses are encoded only once in XML. For example, if the response data includes an ampersand character (&), the character is returned in its regular XML encoding (&). If XMLEscaping is Double, the same ampersand character is XML-encoded twice (&amp;). The Double value for XMLEscaping is useful in some clients, such as PHP, that do not decode text within XML elements. Defaults to 'Single'.

	 * Method: cart_modify()
	 * 	Enables you to change the quantity of items that are already in a remote shopping cart, move items from the active area of a cart to the SaveForLater area or the reverse, and change the MergeCart setting.
	 *
	 * 	To modify the number of items in a cart, you must specify the cart using the CartId and HMAC values that are returned in the <cart_create()> operation. A value similar to HMAC, URLEncodedHMAC, is also returned. This value is the URL encoded version of the HMAC. This encoding is necessary because some characters, such as + and /, cannot be included in a URL. Rather than encoding the HMAC yourself, use the URLEncodedHMAC value for the HMAC parameter.

	 * 	You can use <cart_modify()> to modify the number of items in a remote shopping cart by setting the value of the Quantity parameter appropriately. You can eliminate an item from a cart by setting the value of the Quantity parameter to zero. Or, you can double the number of a particular item in the cart by doubling its Quantity. You cannot, however, use <cart_modify()> to add new items to a cart.

Generally, ContentType should only be changed for REST requests when the Style parameter is set to an XSLT stylesheet. For example, to transform your Amazon Associates Web Service response into HTML, set ContentType to text/html. Allows 'text/xml' and 'text/html'. Defaults to 'text/xml'.
	 * 	ListItemId - _string_ (Optional) The ListItemId parameter is returned by the ListItems response group. The parameter identifies an item on a list, such as a wishlist. To add this item to a cart, you must include in the <cart_create()> request the item's ASIN and ListItemId. The ListItemId includes the name and address of the list owner, which the ASIN alone does not.
	 * 	MergeCart - _boolean_ (Optional) A boolean value that when True specifies that the items in a customer's remote shopping cart are added to the customer's Amazon retail shopping cart.

	// SELLER METHODS

	/**
	 * Method: seller_listing_lookup()
	 * 	Enables you to return information about a seller's listings, including product descriptions, availability, condition, and quantity available. The response also includes the seller's nickname. Each request requires a seller ID.
	 *
	 * 	You can also find a seller's items using ItemLookup. There are, however, some reasons why it is better to use <seller_listing_lookup()>: (a) <seller_listing_lookup()> enables you to search by seller ID. (b) <seller_listing_lookup()> returns much more information than <item_lookup()>.
	 *
	 * 	This operation only works with sellers who have less than 100,000 items for sale. Sellers that have more items for sale should use, instead of Amazon Associates Web Service, other APIs, including the Amazon Inventory Management System, and the Merchant@ API.
	 *
	 * 	If you added your Associates ID to the config.inc.php file, or you passed it into the AmazonAAWS() constructor, it will be passed along in this request automatically.
	 *
	 * Access:
	 * 	public
	 *
	 * Parameters:
	 * 	item_id - _string_ (Optional) Number that uniquely identifies an item. The valid value depends on the value for IdType. Allows an Exchange ID, a Listing ID, an ASIN, or a SKU.
	 * 	id_type - _string_ (Optional) Use the IdType parameter to specify the value type of the Id parameter value. If you are looking up an Amazon Marketplace item, use Exchange, ASIN, or SKU as the value for IdType. Discontinued, out of stock, or unavailable products will not be returned if IdType is Listing, SKU, or ASIN. Those products will be returned, however, if IdType is Exchange. Allows 'Exchange', 'Listing', 'ASIN', 'SKU'.
	 * 	seller_id - _string_ (Optional) Alphanumeric token that uniquely identifies a seller. This parameter limits the results to a single seller ID.
	 * 	opt - _array_ (Optional) Associative array of parameters which can have the following keys:
	 * 	locale - _string_ (Optional) Which Amazon-supported locale do we use? Defaults to United States.
	 *
	 * Keys for the $opt parameter:

	/**
	 * Method: seller_listing_search()
	 * 	Enables you to search for items offered by specific sellers. You cannot use <seller_listing_search()> to look up items sold by merchants. To look up an item sold by a merchant, use <item_lookup()> or <item_search()> along with the MerchantId parameter.
	 *
	 * 	<seller_listing_search()> returns the listing ID or exchange ID of an item. Typically, you use those values with <seller_listing_lookup()> to find out more about those items.
	 *
	 * 	Each request returns up to ten items. By default, the first ten items are returned. You can use the ListingPage parameter to retrieve additional pages of (up to) ten listings. To use Amazon Associates Web Service, sellers must have less than 100,000 items for sale. Sellers that have more items for sale should use, instead of Amazon Associates Web Service, other seller APIs, including the Amazon Inventory Management System, and the Merchant@ API.
	 *
	 * 	<seller_listing_search()> requires a seller ID, which means that you cannot use this operation to search across all sellers. Amazon Associates Web Service does not have a seller-specific operation that does this. To search across all sellers, use <item_lookup()> or <item_search()>.
	 *
	 * 	If you added your Associates ID to the config.inc.php file, or you passed it into the AmazonAAWS() constructor, it will be passed along in this request automatically.
	 *
	 * Access:
	 * 	public
	 *
	 * Parameters:
	 * 	seller_id - _string_ (Required) An alphanumeric token that uniquely identifies a seller. These tokens are created by Amazon and distributed to sellers.
	 * 	opt - _array_ (Optional) Associative array of parameters which can have the following keys:
	 * 	locale - _string_ (Optional) Which Amazon-supported locale do we use? Defaults to United States.
	 *
	 * Keys for the $opt parameter:
	 * 	ContentType - _string_ (Optional) Specifies the format of the content in the response. Generally, ContentType should only be changed for REST requests when the Style parameter is set to an XSLT stylesheet. For example, to transform your Amazon Associates Web Service response into HTML, set ContentType to text/html. Allows 'text/xml' and 'text/html'. Defaults to 'text/xml'.
	 * 	ListingPage - _integer_ (Optional) Page of the response to return. Up to ten lists are returned per page. For customers that have more than ten lists, more than one page of results are returned. By default, the first page is returned. To return another page, specify the page number. Allows 1 through 500.
	 * 	MerchantId - _string_ (Optional) An alphanumeric token distributed by Amazon that uniquely identifies a merchant. Allows 'All', 'Amazon', 'FeaturedBuyBoxMerchant', or a specific Merchant ID. Defaults to 'Amazon'.
	 * 	OfferStatus - _string_ (Optional) Specifies whether the product is available (Open), or not (Closed.) Closed products are those that are discontinued, out of stock, or unavailable. Defaults to 'Open'.
	 * 	ResponseGroup - _string_ (Optional) Specifies the types of values to return. You can specify multiple response groups in one request by separating them with commas.
	 * 	returnCurlHandle - _boolean_ (Optional) A private toggle that will return the CURL handle for the request rather than actually completing the request. This is useful for MultiCURL requests.
	 * 	Sort - _string_ (Optional) Use the Sort parameter to specify how your seller listing search results will be ordered. The -bfp (featured listings - default), applies only to the US, UK, and DE locales. Allows '-startdate', 'startdate', '+startdate', '-enddate', 'enddate', '-sku', 'sku', '-quantity', 'quantity', '-price', 'price |+price', '-title', 'title'.
	 * 	Style - _string_ (Optional) Controls the format of the data returned in Amazon Associates Web Service responses. Set this parameter to "XML," the default, to generate a pure XML response. Set this parameter to the URL of an XSLT stylesheet to have Amazon Associates Web Service transform the XML response. See ContentType.
	 * 	Title - _string_ (Optional) Searches for products based on the product's name. Keywords and Title are mutually exclusive; you can have only one of the two in a request.
	 * 	Validate - _boolean_ (Optional) Prevents an operation from executing. Set the Validate parameter to True to test your request without actually executing it. When present, Validate must equal True; the default value is False. If a request is not actually executed (Validate=True), only a subset of the errors for a request may be returned because some errors (for example, no_exact_matches) are only generated during the execution of a request. Defaults to FALSE.
	 * 	XMLEscaping - _string_ (Optional) Specifies whether responses are XML-encoded in a single pass or a double pass. By default, XMLEscaping is Single, and Amazon Associates Web Service responses are encoded only once in XML. For example, if the response data includes an ampersand character (&), the character is returned in its regular XML encoding (&). If XMLEscaping is Double, the same ampersand character is XML-encoded twice (&amp;). The Double value for XMLEscaping is useful in some clients, such as PHP, that do not decode text within XML elements. Defaults to 'Single'.

	 *
	 * 	A seller must enter their information. Sometimes, sellers do not. In that case, <seller_lookup()> cannot return some seller-specific information.
	 *
	 * 	To look up more than one seller in a single request, insert a comma-delimited list of up to five seller IDs in the SellerId parameter of the REST request.

	// OTHER LOOKUP METHODS

	/**
	 * Method: similarity_lookup()
	 * 	Returns up to ten products per page that are similar to one or more items specified in the request. This operation is typically used to pique a customer's interest in buying something similar to what they've already ordered.
	 *
	 * 	If you specify more than one item, <similarity_lookup()> returns the intersection of similar items each item would return separately. Alternatively, you can use the SimilarityType parameter to return the union of items that are similar to any of the specified items. A maximum of ten similar items are returned; the operation does not return additional pages of similar items. If there are more than ten similar items, running the same request can result in different answers because the ten that are included in the response are picked randomly. The results are picked randomly only when you specify multiple items and the results include more than ten similar items.

	 * 	When you specify multiple items, it is possible for there to be no intersection of similar items. In this case, the operation returns an error.
	 *
	 * 	Similarity is a measurement of similar items purchased, that is, customers who bought X also bought Y and Z. It is not a measure, for example, of items viewed, that is, customers who viewed X also viewed Y and Z.
	 *
	 * 	If you added your Associates ID to the config.inc.php file, or you passed it into the AmazonAAWS() constructor, it will be passed along in this request automatically.
	 *
	 * Access:
	 * 	public
	 *
	 * Parameters:
	 * 	item_id - _string_ (Required) Specifies the item you want to look up. An ItemId is an alphanumeric identifier assigned to an item. You can specify up to ten ItemIds separated by commas.
	 * 	opt - _array_ (Optional) Associative array of parameters which can have the following keys:
	 * 	locale - _string_ (Optional) Which Amazon-supported locale do we use? Defaults to United States.
	 *
	 * Keys for the $opt parameter:
	 * 	Condition - _string_ (Optional) Specifies an item's condition. If Condition is set to "All", a separate set of responses is returned for each valid value of Condition. Allows 'All', 'Collectible', 'Refurbished', or 'Used'.
	 * 	ContentType - _string_ (Optional) Specifies the format of the content in the response. Generally, ContentType should only be changed for REST requests when the Style parameter is set to an XSLT stylesheet. For example, to transform your Amazon Associates Web Service response into HTML, set ContentType to text/html. Allows 'text/xml' and 'text/html'. Defaults to 'text/xml'.
	 * 	MerchantId - _string_ (Optional) Specifies the merchant who is offering the item. MerchantId is an alphanumeric identifier assigned by Amazon to merchants. Make sure to use a Merchant ID and not a Seller ID. Seller IDs are not supported.
	 * 	ResponseGroup - _string_ (Optional) Specifies the types of values to return. You can specify multiple response groups in one request by separating them with commas.
	 * 	returnCurlHandle - _boolean_ (Optional) A private toggle that will return the CURL handle for the request rather than actually completing the request. This is useful for MultiCURL requests.
	 * 	SimilarityType - _string_ (Optional) "Intersection" returns the intersection of items that are similar to all of the ASINs specified. "Random" returns the union of items that are similar to all of the ASINs specified. Only ten items are returned. So, if there are more than ten similar items found, a random selection from the group is returned. For this reason, running the same request multiple times can yield different results.
	 * 	Style - _string_ (Optional) Controls the format of the data returned in Amazon Associates Web Service responses. Set this parameter to "XML," the default, to generate a pure XML response. Set this parameter to the URL of an XSLT stylesheet to have Amazon Associates Web Service transform the XML response. See ContentType.
	 * 	Validate - _boolean_ (Optional) Prevents an operation from executing. Set the Validate parameter to True to test your request without actually executing it. When present, Validate must equal True; the default value is False. If a request is not actually executed (Validate=True), only a subset of the errors for a request may be returned because some errors (for example, no_exact_matches) are only generated during the execution of a request. Defaults to FALSE.
	 * 	XMLEscaping - _string_ (Optional) Specifies whether responses are XML-encoded in a single pass or a double pass. By default, XMLEscaping is Single, and Amazon Associates Web Service responses are encoded only once in XML. For example, if the response data includes an ampersand character (&), the character is returned in its regular XML encoding (&). If XMLEscaping is Double, the same ampersand character is XML-encoded twice (&amp;). The Double value for XMLEscaping is useful in some clients, such as PHP, that do not decode text within XML elements. Defaults to 'Single'.

	/**
	 * Method: tag_lookup()
	 * 	Returns entities based on specifying one to five tags. A tag is a descriptive word that a customer uses to label entities on Amazon's retail web site. Entities can be items for sale, Listmania lists, guides, and so forth. For example, a customer might tag a given entity with the phrase, "BestCookbook". This operation is US-only.
	 *
	 * 	In the tag-related response groups, Tags and TagSummary specify the amount of information returned. The other tag-related response groups, TaggedGuides, TaggedItems, and Tagged listmaniaLists, specify the kind of entity tagged.
